I am a Research Software Development Engineer at Microsoft Research Asia, focusing on **enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities**. My current work includes test-time scaling method (`rStar`), along with ongoing efforts in **training-based methods** and reinforcement learning from human feedback (**RLHF**).

Previously, my research centered on efficient and scalable AI systems for hardware-aware neural architectures. I worked on neural architecture search (NAS) with projects like `ElasticViT`, `SpaceEvo`, and `LitePred`, as well as structured pruning techniques such as `Compresso`.

Before transitioning to AI systems, my early research during my M.S. at `Fudan University` focused on `medical imaging`. I developed foundational frameworks for segmentation, registration, and neurological disease analysis, contributing to early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
